# Welcome to the getML live-demo

**This is a live session from which you can run example notebooks showing how to use getML.**

To get started with getML start with [this](loans-short.ipynb) notebook. It is a jupyter notebook on loan default prediction, which is reduced to the essential. The notebook is derived from the extended version out of our getml-example repository.

# The getML Monitor on mybinder

The getML monitor is a web frontend to the getML software. The getML monitor contains information on the data imported into the engine as well as the trained models and their performance.

Launch the getML Monitor [here](http://localhost:1709).

# More examples

In addition, this demo contains various examples projects to help you to get started
with **relational learning** and **getML**. They can serve as documentation and
as blueprints for your own projects.

Each project solves a typical data science problem in a specific domain. You
can either choose a project by domain or by the underlying machine learning
problem, e.g. binary classification on a time series or regression using a
relational data scheme involving many tables.

Use the following table in order to pick the example projects that best suits your
needs:
