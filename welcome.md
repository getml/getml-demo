# Welcome to the getML live-demo

**This is a live session from which you can run example notebooks showing how to use getML.**

To get started with getML start with [this](loans_demo.ipynb) notebook. It is a jupyter notebook on loan default prediction, which is reduced to the essential.


# Many more examples

This demo contains various examples projects to help you to get started
with **relational learning** and **getML**. They cover different aspects of the software, and can serve as documentation or
as blueprints for your own project.

Each project solves a typical data science problem in a specific domain. You
can either choose a project by domain or by the underlying machine learning
problem, e.g. binary classification on a time series or regression using a
relational data scheme involving many tables.

Avaliable examples projects are listed below.
