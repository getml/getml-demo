# Welcome to the getML live-demo

**This is a live session from which you can run example notebooks showing how to use getML.**

To get started with getML start with [this](loans_demo.ipynb) notebook. It is a jupyter notebook on loan default prediction, which is reduced to the essential.


# Many more examples

This demo contains various examples projects to help you to get started
with relational learning and getML. They cover different aspects of the software, and can serve as documentation or
as blueprints for your own project.

Each project solves a typical data science problem in a specific domain. You
can either choose a project by domain or by the underlying machine learning
problem, e.g. binary classification on a time series or regression using a
relational data scheme involving many tables.

Avaliable examples projects are listed below.
